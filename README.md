## Testing my newly acquired javascript skills to make a simple web based app for the field trip component of BIO2137 Plant Science course.

# Field Stations Map

## Overview
**FieldStationsMap** is an interactive map application that displays the locations of several field stations on Google Maps. This map is designed for ease of use, especially for students in the BIO2137 course who need to quickly locate and navigate to specific stations.
